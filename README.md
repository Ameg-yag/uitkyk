# uitkyk
Uitkyk is a custom Android Frida libary which provides an API to analyze Android applications for malicious activity. Additionally Uitkyk is a collection of resources to assist in the identification of malicious Android applications at runtime. For more information, please see the TROOPERS18 talk here https://troopers.de/troopers18/agenda/uc9azv/

The folder "Frida Scripts" contains some basic Frida scripts to assist in the runtime analysis of Android applications.
